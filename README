HOLE-IN-THE-WALL

A UC Fun Kit v4 game by Ryan Croucher and Jeremy Roberts.

Dodge walls coming from two different directions by moving through the gaps presented. Collect powerups and use them to temporarily clear the board.

CONTROLS:

    Orient the board upright (power cable at the top).

    To start the fun kit, hold S3, then press S2, then release S2 and finally release S3.

    To start the game, press S3.

    GAMEPLAY:

        The navswitch can be moved left, right, up, down to move the player character in the corresponding direction.
        Walls will move across the screen, in phases, first from top to bottom, then from left to right.
        Every time the phase switches, the wall movement speed will increase.

        When walls are coming down, the player can wrap around the board from left to right and right to left.
        When walls are moving across, the player can wrap around the board from top to bottom and bottom to top.

        Move the navswitch to direct your player character through the holes in the walls.

        Periodically, 'powerups' that flash irregularly will appear on the display. Move over these to collect them, and the blue LED will turn on.

        To use the powerup, press S3. This will destroy all walls currently on the board, and light up the screen.

        When the player character comes into contact with a wall, the game will end and the player's score will be displayed.

    To restart the game after a game over, press S3.

Have fun!
